# Types of tests

## Load Testing

A load test is a type of performance test that checks how systems function under a heavy number of concurrent virtual users performing transactions over a certain period of time. 
In other words, the test measures how systems handle heavy load volumes.

### When is it used

Load test when you want to determine how many users your system can actually handle. 
You can configure tests to simulate various user scenarios which can focus on different parts of your system.

## Performance Testing

Performance testing is the general name for tests that check how the system behaves and performs. 
Performance testing examines responsiveness, stability, scalability, reliability, speed and resource usage of your software and infrastructure. 
Different types of performance tests provide you with different data.

### When is it used
 
Run performance tests when you want to check your website and app performance, which may extend to testing servers, databases, networks, etc. 

## Soak Testing

Soak testing is a type of performance evaluation that gauges how an application handles a growing number of users or increasingly taxing tasks over an extended period of time. 
Soak testing is both a type of nonfunctional test and a form of stress testing. 
The process informs software testers whether an application performs satisfactorily after hours or days of usage.

### When is it used

Soak testing  is used to uncover software issues that only become apparent after it runs for extended periods of time, such as a gradual memory leak.

## Spike Testing
Spike testing is a type of performance testing in which an application receives a sudden and extreme increase or decrease in load.
Spike testing addresses more than just an application's maximum load; it also verifies an application's recovery time between activity spikes. 
The word “spike” refers to the sudden increase or decrease in traffic.

### When is it used

Spike testing is used to determine the behavior of a software application when it receives extreme variations in traffic.

## Stress Testing

A stress test is a type of performance test that checks the upper limits of your system by testing it under extreme loads. 
Stress tests examine how the system behaves under intense loads and how it recovers when going back to normal usage.

### When is it used 

Run stress tests when you want to know your system’s endurance capabilities.
